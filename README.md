Let's try out Terraform
Install Terraform
Initialise cloud provider
Run "terraform init"
Set-up a security group
Make sure that you set up the file
Try whether or not it works with "terraform plan" . Here we would expect something to add but 
not necessarily something to change or to destroy.
Don't display your credentials openly, you would probably want to use something like Ansible 
vault or similar to store your credentials, do not store in plain text
Once we have finished setting up our resources, we want to destroy them "terraform destroy"
